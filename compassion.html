	I enjoy movies. I think it is because they can capture ideas that are not easily described with text. Films can speak to you on many levels simultaneously, which is why there is a healthy market for people explaining what a given movie "means." The multi-modal aspect of films also helps: that you are engaging with vocals, visuals and music simultaneously. Perhaps this allows cinema to more directly encode raw human emotions. It is maybe closer to a theoretical brain-to-brain interface than literature. That is not to say that film replaces literature, as some expected in era when the art form first emerged.
