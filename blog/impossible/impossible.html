    <h3>Intractable Does not Imply Impossible</h3>

    <p>
        Problems exist in a range of solvability. I think that as an industry we do not comprehend this
        concept correctly. Take, for example, the halting problem. The halting problem states that
        you cannot write a program that can predict <em>for all programs</em> whether they will complete.
        This does not mean that you cannot predict this for many programs. In fact, with static analysis
        you can solve a subset of the halting problem for many classes of programs. All non-beginner programmers
        can determine that the following snippet will not halt:
    </p>

    <pre>
while (true) {
        printf("Hello world!\n");
}
    </pre>

    <p>
        Knowing that the halting problem exists is akin to knowing that there will likely be a heat-death of
        the universe. It is a fact, but you can let this information affect you in different ways. It is not
        yet known how far we can "solve" the halting problem, but I find it existing to consider what the
        possibilities are.
