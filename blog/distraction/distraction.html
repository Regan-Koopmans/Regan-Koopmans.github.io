    <h3>Removing Distraction</h3>

    <p>
        I am not a massive fan of New Year's resolutions, but I do think that the beginning of a year is
        a good time to reflect on goals and habits. In the first few weeks of this year I have dramatically
        reduced the number of distractions I encounter during my productive hours. This includes YouTube,
        among other sites. After chatting to friends and colleagues I have concluded that YouTube is particularly
        pernicious to attention. My theory for this is that YouTube can often <em>feel</em> productive. If you
        are watching a technical talk while your project builds, is that not a good use of your time?
    </p>

    <p>
        My position now is that I think YouTube is dramatically less "educational" than it feels, unless you are
        actively watching (rather than passively). This is also true for Hacker News in my opinion, which might
        keep you up to speed with developments in tech, but I tend to read the comments around the news rather
        than the news itself.
