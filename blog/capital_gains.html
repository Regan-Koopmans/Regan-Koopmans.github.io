    <h2>Capital Gains</h2>
    <p>
        In theory, governments should encourage economic activities that promote the
        well-being of citizens. In practice governments tend to encourage people put
        long-term savings into retirement funds, which often get inflated out of
        existence, or disappear during financial crashes. Money that is in circulation
        is more valuable for GDP, but not necessarily for individual citizens.

        The two forms of long-term investments that have been the most stable in history are
        property and particularly precious metals. If a government puts in place policies that
        cause large amounts of inflation, these commidities will have a higher currency price
        (although their actual "value" may stay constant). Governments then claim that you
        owe them tax on the increase in currency price. This is completely backwards to me.
        This is paramount to deciding to home-school your children, and having schools claim
        that you owe them education gains tax. If I can preserve my wealth outside of the
        systems that you promote, you cannot rightfully claim any stake if my choices turn
        out to be correct.
