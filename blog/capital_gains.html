	In theory, governments should encourage economic activities that promote the
	well-being of citizens. In practice governments tend to encourage people put
	long-term savings into retirement funds, which often get inflated out of
	existence, or disappear during financial crashes. Money that is in circulation 
	is more valuable for GDP, but not necessarily for individual citizens.

    The two forms of long-term investments that have been the most stable in history are
    property and particularly precious metals. If a government puts in place policies that 
    cause large amounts of inflation, these commidities will have a higher currency price 
    (although their actual "value" may stay constant). Governments then claim that you
    owe them tax on the increase in currency price. This is completely backwards to me.
    This is paramount to deciding to home-school your children, and having schools claim
    that you owe them education gains tax. If I can preserve my wealth outside of the
    systems that you promote, you cannot rightfully claim any stake if my choices turn
    out to be correct.
