    <h3>TypeDB: An intriguing new database</h3>
    
    <p>
        I have been following the development of a new database called TypeDB (formerly Grakn) for some time.
        As the name suggests, this is a database with an emphasis on a strong type-system. At first this might
        not sound revolutionary; most relational databases have type systems. What makes TypeDB unique is that
        it allows for user-defined types and the ability to attach logic to these types. Combined with this, the database
        offers an inference engine that can allow the database to deduce facts about your data. Subjectively this
        feels somewhat like writing a Prolog program. I'm excited to see where this database goes.
