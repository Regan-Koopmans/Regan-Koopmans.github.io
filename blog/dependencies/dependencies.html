    <h3>Dependencies and Abstractions</h3>

    <p>
        Commercial software increasingly involves many layers of complicated dependency management and abstractions.
        I would like to address why I think this is a problem:
    </p>

    <h4>Dependencies</h4>

    <p>
        In my view, it is an anti-pattern that large established software companies depend on hobby software
        written by a small group of contributors, if not a single individual. I think that collaboration in software
        is a great idea, but we should be more realistic and accept the state of most open-source libraries.
        Here I am not talking about established open-source projects backed by companies, non-profits and foundations.
        I am speaking specifically about libraries that would be very easy to in-house, but nevertheless are
        externalised to the pet projects of people in their spare-time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Companies use open-source code because it saves time and money. Code borrowed is code that does not
        need to be written. It is too tempting for most businesses to resist. You download 100 dependencies
        using npm, write some glue code, and your software solution is near complete. However, over time the
        decision to outsouce this work inhibits your own code. You begin to spend more time solving dependency
        issues than the problems that are core to your business. Every new dependency you add exponentially
        increases the number of possible conflicts and incompatibilities. Your dependencies have
        their own dependencies, and at some point the combinatorial problem begins to exceed the ability for both humans
        and tooling to solve. Most engineers would far rather spend time implementing some functionality than
        live in dependency hell. The bespoke solution would naturally fit the requirements of your code better.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dependencies also exist outside your control. You do not know whether they will exist in the next 5,
        10, 20 years. I am extremely skeptical that a Python project made today, without any active work, will
        still run in 10 years. If we are not writing software to last at least that long, why not just write
        your software in Excel? You should "own" as much of the code as possible. The problem of dependencies is
        confounded by the next topic: Abstractions.
