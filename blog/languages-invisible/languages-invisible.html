    <h3>Programming Languages Should Be "Invisible"</h3>

    <p>
        It may seem obvious to state that programmming languages do not exist for
        the benefit of the computer. Programming languages are generally a compromise
        between the intent of the programmer(s) and the ability for that intent to be
        expressed in some formal language. The inherent capabilities of the hardware
        do not change. This is not a controversial statement, and I would imagine most
        programmers would agree with it. However, I think this is worth keeping in
        mind when evaluating the merits of programming languages or paradigms.
    </p>

        Programming languages solve human problems, fundamentally. These problems
        might be our ability to write lines of code, or to reason about state. The problem
        might be our ability to share a context or ontology with each other. These types of
        problems are deeply rooted in human psychology and neurology. The core of what makes
        "goto" harmful is that human brains cannot reason about it in moderately sized
        software projects.

    <p>
        I remember hearing a quote that operating systems should be "invisible". This
        means that users should only be aware of the operating system insofar as it
        enables applications. This is broadly true, given that most of the advertised
        updates to commercial operating systems are actually in userland (improvements to
        photo galleries etc).
    </p>

    <p>
        I think that programming languages should have a similar property. What is primary
        to a language should be the problem that the users are trying to solve. A programming
        language should allow the programmer to forget about details not related to their
        problem without incurring dramatic reductions in efficiency.
