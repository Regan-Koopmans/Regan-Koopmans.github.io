    <h2>Stop Inventing Incomplete Query Languages</h2>
    <p>
        The query languages offered with many "big data" cloud solutions are quite terrible.
        I am referring to languages like PromQL/LogQL and Google's "logging query language". For one,
        these query languages fundamentally have extremely similar requirements: filtering text by
        some substring or perhaps a regular expression. In most cases simply offering a 1986 standard
        SQL compliance interface would be sufficient and better than some proprietary query language.
        This must be motivated by vendor-lock-in aspirations.
