    <h3>Utopia, then what?</h3>
    <p>
        I find arguments surrounding potential utopias quite interesting. I've heard people talk about
        utopias as an ending: "We invent powerful AI, we have a utopia, the end". Or "industrialisation creates
        a surplus, everyone has everything they could ever want, the end". But for me, it is far more
        interesting to think about a utopia as the beginning of something else. Does the "perfect world" stay "perfect"
        forever?
    </p>

    <p>
        If we could build a society considered "utopian", what would happen to that society one day later? How is
        the human psyche affected by having every need met? How stable would such a population be?
