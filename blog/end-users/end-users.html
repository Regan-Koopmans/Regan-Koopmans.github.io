    <h3>End-users are not stupid</h3>
    <p>
        There is a prevailing sentiment in the software industry that end-users are unintelligent.
        I think that this is not only incorrect, but quite dangerous. To be clear I am not against
        good UX design, I am talking here about the subtle antagonistic relationship that some
        software creators have with the people who use their software.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are many intelligent people who struggle to use software systems. This might be because
        their particular background has not exposed them to the milieu of shared experience that
        computer-oriented people acquire (often at a young age).
    </p>

    <p>
        Software engineers will give a knowing laugh when a user makes a "silly" error, and fail to see
        that the mistake is in fact their own. The best software, in my opinion, believes the user to be
        competent. Good software assumes that the user is teachable, and does not require guard-rails to
        protect them from themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
        Believing that the end-user is stupid removes any curiousity about the unique concerns of that user.
        If you can brush off their struggle as incompetence, you have an excuse to ignore what might be a
        serious UX experience, or some fundamental inconsistency in the software product.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead of taking a patronising stance, software engineers should optimise communication rather
        than limiting the power of the users. Set reasonable defaults, but allow for customisation.
        Notify users when an action is unconventional, but allow them to do it if they give sufficient
        confirmation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Designing for someone who you think is stupid leads to dark patterns and encourages a ivory-tower
        relationship between the developer and the user. Assume the user is teachable, always.
