    <h3>Synthetic Aperture Radar</h3>

    <p>
        This post mostly serves as a living personal reference to SAR. I claim no authority on this topic.

        Light and radio waves exist on the same spectrum: the electro-magnetic spectrum. This might
        lead you to wonder whether it is possible to take radio "photographs" using the same techniques
        that we have for visible light. In principle this is true, we would just need a large enough
        camera. Unfortunately, given how much larger radio waves are, such a camera would be impractical
        to build.

        However, this is not the only option available to us. We can construct a large image by taking
        a moving series of smaller images and combining them. With this technique, our sensor can be a lot smaller
        relative to the image captured.
    </p>

    <p>
        This has some interesting side effects. First: the doppler effect. Since our sensor is moving, one side of the
        image will be brighter than the other independent of the image contents. The second strange effect is that since
        the image is a composite of multiple angles, we will probably see a speckle or noisy final image.
