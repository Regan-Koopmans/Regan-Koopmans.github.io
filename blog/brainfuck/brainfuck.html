    <h3>Brainfuck</h3>
    <p>
        Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language. I had heard of it in university,
        and was aware of its reputation for being an inscrutible and difficult to write.
        I assumed that the author had constructed the langauge to be as difficult as
        possible. This did not interest me as a "Big Idea" for a language, so I did not
        look into it further.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, recently I have been looking into this language again while reading about
        virtual machines. Contrary to what I had thought, the premise of the language was not
        to frustrate people but to create the simplest possible compiler. This is far more
        interesting to me. When I attempted to write a Brainfuck compiler it was indeed simple,
        and I was able to complete a satisfactory implementation in one sitting.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was the perfect size for a self-contained afternoon project, but it was also
        <em>really</em> fun. Against all odds, people have written some non-trivial programs
        in the langauge, and it is quite exciting to see them working on an interpreter on
        an interpreter I personally wrote.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also now believe that writing a Brainfuck interpreter is superior to "Hello World" when
        trying out a new langauge. "Hello World" is a good test for whether your environment
        is ready compile and run programs, but it really does not convey anything insightful
        about how the syntax is structured. A brainfuck interpreter will force you
        to learn how a language defines variables, reads files, and perform basic conditional
        logic.
    </p>

    <p>
        After completing the brainfuck interpeter in your target language, you can then compare
        <em>your</em> implementation to <em>others</em>. This will almost certainly reveal some
        less obvious idiosyncrasies and standard practices in the language you did not know about.
    </p>

    <p>
        I won't go into the details of Brainfuck or how to go about implementing an interpreter
        (there are plenty such resources online), but I would recommend this as a
        first foray into interpreters and virtual machines.
