        Stock markets are operating systems for resource allocation. By this I mean that
        stock markets are distributed systems comprised of humans and mostly bots. These
        systems anticipate which ventures will produce value in the future. Generally
        speaking, they do not generate value themselves, but serve as a medium to communicate
        information about value. If you know something about a company that others do not,
        and trade with this information, you will be given a reward for your marginal
        contribution to the aggregate knowledge of the market.

    <p class="prose pt-2">
        This is all to say that I largely agree in the notion that stock markets serve a
        function in society. However, I do not endorse the get-rich-quick schemes that are
        often associated with it. My personal opinion is that too many intelligent people
        are misallocated in optimising these systems by fractional amounts to capture value,
        rather than increasing the net amount of value in the world.
