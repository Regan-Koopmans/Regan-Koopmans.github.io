	I recently read The Technological Republic by Alex Karp. It is fantastic. I will not spoil the book, but I would like to comment on one of the topics discussed. Modern software has largely failed to address the "big problems" facing humanity. The smartest minds in software go into "FANG" companies, which produce products based on convenience, advertising and entertainment. It is bizarre that the most prestigious software jobs are not in industries like energy, medicine and physics. Google, whose stated purpose is to "organise the world's information", has failed to innovate for a decade. Rather than seeing this in a negative light I think that this is actually exciting, since we should expect the potential of software to be way higher than is currently manifest.
