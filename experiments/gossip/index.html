    <h1>Consensus Algorithms</h1>
    <p>
        One of the most important problems in distributed computing is that of consensus. In short, 
        this is about getting actors to agree on some decision or the state of some information. 
        Suppose you have some social network, and that this social network is too large to host from
        a single server. You might choose to have a server per country. This begs the question: How
        do you keep the servers in sync? How do you make sure that the information on each server is
        the same? This is the problem of consensus.

    <p>
        Below we will explore some of the ways that this problem has been solved, with their respective
        advantages and disadvantages.

    <h2>Gossip Consensus</h2>

    <p>
        It is no secret that gossip spreads. As with many problems we find a solution already in nature.
        In gossip consensus, each node in the network has a state. This state can be anything, but for
        simplicity we will use a boolean value. Each node has a list of its neighbors, and it will send
        its state to each of its neighbors. When a node receives a state from a neighbor, it will update
        its own state to match that of the neighbor. This process is repeated until all nodes have the
        same state. Under this model, information spreads like a virus, and quickly reaches all nodes in 
        the network.
    </p>

    <p>
        Below you can see a simulation of how quickly all the nodes in a network can be brought to the same
        state. The nodes are represented by circles, and the state of each node is represented by its color.
        You may observe that all nodes will be red after about 11 steps, and almost always after 15 steps.
        This is because gossip algorithms have logarithmic convergence time. This means that the time it takes
        for all nodes to reach the same state is proportional to the logarithm of the number of nodes in the
        network.
