    <h1>Novum Magistrerium</h1>

    <p><em>Status: in progress</em></p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      As of the time of writing, it is common to call progressional programmers "software engineers."
      This name indicates that developing software is broader than the mere act of programming (i.e typing).
      I tend to agree with this; producing software requires a diverse range of activities.
      I do, however, take issue with the term "engineer."
      There is a palpable lack of engineering in the software industry in comparison to other modes of production.
      
      Some engineering methodologies such as Kanban have been "ported" from manufacturing into software.
      While they have seen wide adoption, these methologies have largely failed to increase the overall standard of software.

      The purpose of this document is to offer an analysis of the current state of software, and a vision for how software can support human flourishing for the next 1000 years or more.
      I want to emphasize that this is <em>not</em> a manifesto. This document promotes ideas but not idealogies.

    <h2>The Role of Software in Complex Societies</h2>

    <p>
      Software feels inevitable. I wager that any sufficiently advanced human society will have some form of software.

    <p>
      There is a high probability that software written day could run, largely unaltered, fifty years from now.
