<h1 id="a-theory-of-software">a theory of software</h1>
<p>As the scope and complexity of software increases, so does the
potential for harm. The failure of an important software system is now
comparable to that of large physical structures such as dams or bridges.
Despite this, there is a distinct lack of true engineering practice in
the software industry. Software professionals wear the title of
“software engineer”, but the average quality of software products is
generally low and prone to failure.</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to offer an big-picture analysis on
the purpose of software, and a vision for how it can support human
flourishing for the next 1000 years or more. This is not a manifesto.
This document promotes ideas but not idealogies. I have tried to write
this document such that deep knowledge on software and hardware should
not be necessary.</p>
<h2 id="the-human-and-the-machine">the human and the machine</h2>
<p>In order to talk about software we should first define it. For this
document I will define software as a contract between human intention
and machine capability. To explain this, take the following pseudo-code
snippet for example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This program computes the sum of 1 and 1 and displays this
<em>somewhere</em>. The software here is not the text itself. Text is
merely a convenient representation for an expression of machine
abilities arranged against human desires. Observe that this program
could be fulfilled by many different existing and future physical
machines. For all such machines we would expect to see “2” displayed to
the user. The program above is abstract: there is no specification for
how the value 1 should be internally represented, or how the value of 2
should be formatted when printed to the user. Similarly to legal
contracts, contracts between users and machines can be terse or verbose.
In cases where contracts contain ambiguity (such as verbal agreements),
there is typically more work required in determining the interpretation
of the contract. Such is the case in software, whereby certain checks
and balances can be deferred to the run time rather than defined ahead
of time.</p>
