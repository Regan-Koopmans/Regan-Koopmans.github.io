    <h2>Opinions</h2>

    <p>
        These are some opinions that I currently hold. They are subject to change. I have expanded on
        some of these ideas in blog posts.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Software Engineering is not engineering</li>
        <li>Computer Science is not a science (the German word "informatica" is far better)</li>
        <li>End-users are not stupid</li>
        <li>Software can be "complete", within a reasonable definition of complete</li>
        <li>Memory is cheap, but not free</li>
        <li>Intractable does not imply impossible</li>
    </ul>
